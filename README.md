  --insertsize, -n <i>:   mean insert size (default: 200)
    --insertsd, -s <i>:   insert size standard deviation (default: 50)
     --threads, -t <i>:   number of threads to use (default: 8)
         --version, -v:   Print version and exit
            --help, -h:   Show this message

```

## Requirements

### Ruby

First, you'll need Ruby v1.9.3 or greater installed. You can check with:

`ruby --version`

If you don't have Ruby installed, or you need a higher version, I recommend using [RVM](http://rvm.io/) as your Ruby Version Manager. To install RVM along with the latest Ruby, just run:

`\curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable`

### Rubygems

Your Ruby installation *should* come with RubyGems, the package manager for Ruby. You can check with:

`gem --version`

If you don't have it installed, I recommend installing the latest version of Ruby and RubyGems using the RVM instructions above (in the Requirements:Ruby section.

##Â Development status

This software is in very early development. Nevertheless, we welcome bug reports.
